This is a simple php backend to add information to a database
this example takes a post request from the username and
password fields then stores those into a database for other tasks

The current database used in the config variable can be changed by changing 
said variable, if the database is changed you will need to use a different query
as the current one is specific to the current database

you can also change the location of the user after the php by changeing 
line 34 simple replace the current URL with the desired one
